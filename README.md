# Academic CV

Curriculum vitae written in TeX. Based on a Template by Theodore P. Pavlic. Please refer to Pavlic's original TeX CV for sections that I might have cut out.

This is my active CV written in TeX. This is for general use and may not align with your personal or institutional requirements for content/structure. Feel free to borrow the template and make your own TeX CV.
